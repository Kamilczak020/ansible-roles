# Docker

This is a role to facilitate the installation of Docker.

## Note
This uses the official docker (`docker-ce`) instead of the less frequently updated, unofficial `docker-io` which for some reason people still use more often. Not very surprising, given how people still stuff mongodb everywhere.
