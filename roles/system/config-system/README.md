# Config System

This is a base, fresh-system configuration, which installs basic packages, upgrades the system, sets up users and their SSH keys and floating IP settings.

It is recommended to use this on a brand new system deployment.
After this role is complete, I recommend running the [secure-system role](../secure-system).
